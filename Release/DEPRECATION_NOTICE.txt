	Starting now in 2022Q100  release.
	Deprecating the execution of storage of these 4 tables.  Real-time access will be provided instead.
		All triggers will be defaulted to off in this release.
		A future release will remove the related resources and drop the tables.
		i.	METRICS_ACR_ABUOT – populated nightly by Cache_AllCustom_AccessByUserOverTime / kpimetricsTrig_19_AllCustom_AccessByUserOverTime
			1.	Real-time view: /services/databases/ASAssets/KPImetrics/AllCustomReports/AccessByUserOvertimeRT
			2.  Original view [/services/databases/ASAssets/KPImetrics/AllCustomReports/AccessByUserOvertime] is mapped to AccessByUserOvertimeRT
		ii.	METRICS_ACR_AROPOT – populated nightly by Cache_AllCustom_ActiveResourcesOverPeriodOfTime / kpimetricsTrig_20_AllCustom_ActiveResourcesOverPeriodOfTime
			1.	Real-time view: /services/databases/ASAssets/KPImetrics/AllCustomReports/ResourceAccessByUsersRT
			2.  Original view [/services/databases/ASAssets/KPImetrics/AllCustomReports/ResourceAccessByUsers] is mapped to ResourceAccessByUsersRT
		iii.	METRICS_ACR_RCD – populated nightly by Cache_AllCustom_ResourceCount_Details / kpimetricsTrig_21_AllCustom_ResourceCount_Details
			1.	Real-time view: /services/databases/ASAssets/KPImetrics/AllCustomReports/ResourceCount_DetailsRT
			2.  Original view [/services/databases/ASAssets/KPImetrics/AllCustomReports/ResourceCount_Details] is mapped to ResourceCount_DetailsRT
		iv.	METRICS_ACR_RCT – populated nightly by Cache_AllCustom_ResourceCount_Total / kpimetricsTrig_22_AllCustom_ResourceCount_Total
			1.	Real-time view: /services/databases/ASAssets/KPImetrics/AllCustomReports/ResourceCount_TotalRT

	Going forward, KPImetrics will no longer integrate with LDAP data which was "optionally" used to augment the following tables:
		metrics_sessions_hist
		metrics_resources_usage_hist
		metrics_requests_hist
		
	Previously, if configured /KPImetrics/Customize/LDAP_PERSON was used to integrate with the /KPImetrics/Physical/Metadata/LDAP1 and LDAP2.
	In the spirit of simplifying this already complex software offering, it has been deemed prudent and necessary to deprecate this feature.
	After working with many customers over the years, this feature was either never configured or was too difficult to configure and maintain.
	
	Technically speaking, each of the 3 tables listed above contains the "user" and "domain" columns which provide a key into an organization's
		LDAP table.  It is the position of the maintainer of KPImetrics that if a customer wants to integrate with LDAP data, they should
		feel free to maintain their own LDAP tables and provide their own integration with that data rather than KPImetrics maintaining
		extra logic and columns for each row of data.

	By removing this feature, it will simplify the installation scripts, table structure, transformation and data transfer scripts.
	
	Deprecate target Date / resource impact:
		Beginning May 2022, there will be a release that will drop tables and columns and TDV resources associated with LDAP.  The following resources will be affected:
